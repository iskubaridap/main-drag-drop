            <p>The Cloud problem isn't just about managing software. Allowing employees to use their own devices increases productivity and employee satisfaction, while lowering equipment costs for the business. As the boundaries between company interests
                and employee privacy are increasingly blurred, it is no wonder only</p>
            <p><strong><em>36% of companies say they can enforce data-loss prevention in the Cloud.</em></strong></p>
            <p>With so many devices in play, the idea of controlling them all can seem overwhelming. How can we keep sensitive client data off unmanaged devices when the line between managed and unmanaged devices is so blurred? Then, once the data has made
                it to a managed device, how do we continue to protect that data?</p>
