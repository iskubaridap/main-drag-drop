        <p>When surveyed, employees will self-report using as many as 32 Cloud services on average. When looking at the actual usage data (as opposed to a survey), the number of Cloud services in use balloons to 1,945 on average. That is a massive amount
            of policies, procedures, and security settings to sift through.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that's why only <strong><em>33% of companies say they can control application collaboration settings</em></strong>.</p>
        <p>To that point, the adoption of Cloud-based file sharing services has made it easy for anyone to share files regardless of their content. In the Corporate world, this can pose some very serious concerns. Companies aren’t just worried about
            keeping sensitive information like source code, trade secrets, financial information, and other data from falling into the wrong hands. They are also concerned about violating regulations such as HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and other industry
            rules that may leave them exposed to millions of dollars in fines and loss of revenue. Remember the Shared Responsibility Model? The <strong>Customer, NOT the CSP</strong>, is <strong>responsible</strong> for the safety of their data across
            all three Cloud platforms, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS!</p>
        <p>Let’s look at two more risk models. In this first scenario, we find a typical risk model associated with systems of record such as Office 365. Employees of a major Pharma company are working on a crucial project for a new drug formula, keeping
            associated data in a OneDrive folder in the Drug Company’s Office 365 Tenant in the Cloud. A disgruntled employee attempts to share this confidential folder with a competitor by trying to create a shared link.</p>
        <p>The second model depicts a Fortune 1000 Company based in the USA with offices in Europe and Asia, and they use Office365 SharePoint, as their workforce is mostly remote. These users access files and data to collaborate and create, sharing
            files in the Cloud from anywhere with a decent Internet connection. The Company does NOT want any&nbsp; high-value or regulated data, such as PCI, or PI, stored there, because if this data falls into the wrong hands, or is exposed or stolen,
            it could cost the Company hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue, fines, lost Market share, lawsuits, and more.</p>
        <p>How can <span class="red-text">M</span>VISION Cloud help them protect their data in the Cloud? Don't forget, you can tap and hold any tile to learn more about what each solution does.</p>
